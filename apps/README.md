# FocusFlow

**FocusFlow** is a unified smart inbox built as a Django app (inside your portfolio project).  
It consolidates messages from multiple channels, uses AI to prioritize and summarize them, and extracts actionable tasks â€” helping users focus on what matters.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision & Goals

- **Unified Inbox**: Merge emails, Slack/Teams, WhatsApp, etc. into one timeline per workspace  
- **AI Prioritization & Summaries**: Automatically label messages as Urgent / Action / FYI / Spam, and generate readable summaries  
- **Action Extraction & Task Management**: Create actionable tasks from messages (deadlines, follow-ups, assignments)  
- **Focus Mode**: Filter out noise â€” only critical messages surface  
- **Analytics & Insights**: Track time spent by channel, most active contacts, communication trends  
- **Monetization Strategy**:  
  - *Free plan*: basic email integration + daily summary  
  - *Pro plan*: multiple integrations, focus mode, advanced AI  
  - *Enterprise*: team insights, dashboards, company-level metrics
