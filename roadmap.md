“I want to build a Django portfolio project. Please break this project into 30 organized daily steps so I can work on it consistently every day. For now, keep each step high-level (not too technical or detailed) so that I have a solid roadmap. Later, I’ll ask you to expand specific steps in depth. The goal is to have a clear foundation, with tasks arranged in a logical order — from setup, planning, and basic structure to features, deployment, and polish. Present the outline as a numbered day-by-day plan (Day 1 through Day 30).”

Would you like me to also group these 30 steps into weekly milestones (e.g., Week 1 = Planning & Setup, Week 2 = Core Structure, etc.) so it’s even easier to track progress?
